# Simple Weather App
![](https://i.imgur.com/9uZUMhJ.png)

 I made a weather forecast app with Flutter. I preferred to keep minimal UI. Simple two-screen. Weather screen and search city screen.

If you want to run code, you need to set your API key in the WeatherService.dart file.
Or you can download it from [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simple-weather-app-minimalist/id6470280702 "Apple AppStore") or[ Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.muratbaykor.simple_weather_app " Google PlayStore").



#### 
- HTTP request from restful API:  [WeatherAPI](http://weatherapi.com/ "WeatherAPI")
- [Flutter Geolocator Plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator#flutter-geolocator-plugin "Flutter Geolocator Plugin") to access location and location permission
- [Shared preferences Plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences "Shared preferences plugin") to keep search history
- [Loading Animation Widget for loading animation spinnir](https://pub.dev/packages/loading_animation_widget "Loading Animation Widget for loading animation spinnir")
- JSON parsing with custom model
- Proper error handle
- Asynchronous programming (Future, async/await)
